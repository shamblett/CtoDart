TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	CtoT.Txl

Description:
	Example programming language translator, C to Turing.

	Part of a suite of translators between C, Turing and Pascal
	implemented as part of an undergraduate thesis project to support
	language-independent teaching in computing science.

	As an undergraduate project, this is only a limited partial solution
	that works for simple programs.  It does however serve to demonstrate
	the general technique.
